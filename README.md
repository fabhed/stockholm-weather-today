To create a website that shows the current weather in Stockholm, we will use Python with Flask as the web framework and the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data. We will also use the requests library to make API calls.

First, let's create the necessary files and their purposes:

1. app.py: The main entry point of the Flask application.
2. templates/index.html: The HTML template for the homepage.
3. requirements.txt: The list of Python dependencies for the project.

Now, let's create the content of each file:

app.py
